# Chicago Election Results Map
An interactive map of past Chicago election results built with Leaflet and D3. The map currently displays results from the 2015 and 2019 municipal general and runoff elections.

[View the map here.](https://spencerchan.github.io/chi-election-results-map/)

Election results were scraped from the Chicago Board of Election Commissioner's website and cleaned using this [Python script](https://github.com/spencerchan/chicago-elections-scraper).

In the future, I plan to add results from recent state and presidential primary and general elections. I also plan to integrate data from the U.S. Census Bureau to the map so that precinct-level results are filterable by selected demographic and socioeconomic measurements.
